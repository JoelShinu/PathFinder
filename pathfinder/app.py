# Main application logic

# User Input:
#     Allow users to input their destinations.
#     Set a date interval for the entire trip.
#     Specify the minimum amount of time they want to spend in each country.

# Data Retrieval:
#     Integrate with flight and hotel APIs to fetch real-time data.
#     Retrieve information on flight schedules, prices, and hotel availability.
#     Ensure that the APIs you choose provide the necessary data for your optimization algorithms.

# Optimization:
#     Implement an algorithm to find the optimal travel plan based on user inputs.
#     Consider factors like flight costs, travel time, layovers, and hotel expenses.
#     You might need to solve a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or use other optimization techniques.

# Cost Calculation:
#     Calculate the total cost of the travel plan based on flights and hotels.
#     Consider additional costs such as transportation within cities, meals, and activities.

# User Interface:
#     Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for input and result display.
#     Provide options for users to customize their preferences and constraints.
#     Display the optimized travel plan, including flight itineraries and hotel stays.

# Third-Party Services:
#     Integrate with payment gateways if you plan to handle bookings directly through your application.
#     Use mapping services to display the travel route and highlight destinations.

# Notifications:
#     Implement notifications for users, such as reminders for upcoming flights or suggested activities in each destination.
    
# Feedback and Reviews:
#     Allow users to leave feedback and reviews about the suggested travel plan.
#     Use this feedback to improve your application and provide better recommendations in the future.
    
# Security and Privacy:
#     Implement secure practices, especially if your application deals with personal and financial information.
    
# Testing:
#     Test your application thoroughly to ensure a smooth user experience and correct results.
    
# Documentation:
#     Provide clear documentation for users and developers, explaining how to use your application and any APIs you've integrated.
